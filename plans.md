#### In Paris Attractions

[Menagerie du Jardin des Plantes](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g187147-d189240-Reviews-Menagerie_du_Jardin_des_Plantes-Paris_Ile_de_France.html) - Zoo

[Boat Tour](http://goparis.about.com/od/sightsattractions/a/Paris_Boat_Tour.htm)

[Musee d 'Orsay or the Louvre](http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k2069986-Musee_d_Orsay_or_the_Louvre-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)

#### Definite - Disneyland

You go to Disney-Paris by RER (train) and it takes about 45 minutes.
Disneyland Ticket + Bus Price
$354.00

#### Likely - Versailles

[TripAdvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187148-d188681-Reviews-Chateau_de_Versailles-Versailles_Yvelines_Ile_de_France.html)

"To get there: The Paris Metro can get you as far as Pont de Sevres at
the end of Metro line 9. From there, transfer to bus 171. Also, trains
direct to Versailles Chantiers, which is a short walk to the palace,
leave from Gare Montparnasse and take about 40 minutes’ travel time.
Versailles is open Tuesdays through Sundays, 9am to 5pm."

"Take the RER C train line (Yellow) from any of the stations along the left bank. Metro tickets are not accepted for travel to Versailles, you must buy an RER ticket, or have a pass that includes the suburban zones. Some of the RER stations do not have ticket offices (gichet), but do have ticket machines. Beware that US Visa cards do not work in these machines. You either have to use a European credit card or coins. At least some Metro stations sell RER tickets at the ticket office and also have ticket machines that accept Euro bills. Buy tickets to the Versaille Rive Gauche station. If you select English language from a ticket machine the station will be named Chateau Versailles."

20 Euros for all access pass.


#### Possible - Fontainebleau

"Steeped in centuries of royal history, the palace and surrounding forest of Fontainebleau housed French monarchs starting from the 13th century. An excursion here will sate both history and architecture buffs and nature-lovers, who will find miles of hiking trails in the historic park and forest around the palace. Barbizon, a town which has gained fame as the home of painters such as Millet, is nestled in the Fontainebleau forest and is also worth a detour."


"If you're at all outdoorsy, spend time hiking in the dense
Fontainebleau forest, just on the outskirts of the town, where the
French Royalty once held elaborate hunts."

"To get to Fontainebleau, take 40 min. train ride from Gare de Lyon to
the Fontainebleau-Avon station; (about 8 euro one-way); a taxi into
the center of town costs about 10 euro, but there's also shuttle bus service to the
Chateau for 3 euro round-trip.""


#### Possible - Cathedrale de Chartres

The train from Paris takes just about 30 minutes.
["CHARTRES is one of the easiest D-I-Y daytrips that you can do from
Paris. It's as simple as making you're way to GARE MONTPARNASSE and
purchasing a SNCF/TER train ticket (24,80 € r.t 2nd) to CHARTRES,
boarding the train. then 70 minutes (direct, no train changes en
route) later stepping off at the station in Chartres, then a pleasant
10 minute stroll up the hill from the train station to the cathedral
and the old quarter of the city."](http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187122-d258096-r55494239-Cathedrale_de_Chartres-Chartres_Loire_Valley_Centre.html)

#### Possible - Chantilly

13 Euro admission

["The trip from Paris was easy--less than 30 minutes, 16 euros round trip."](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g227607-d246223-Reviews-Chateau_de_Chantilly-Chantilly_Oise_Picardy.html)

"This historical building, consisting of 2 parts that are connected into one Château, is open to the public every day but Tuesday. It houses the Condé Museum with one of the finest collection of ancient painting in France"

#### Possible - Provins
["If you're looking to get a taste of what a real medieval town would
have looked like Provins is the place to go."](http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k4482391-Day_trip_from_Paris_to_Provins_or_Senlis-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)
The train runs directly to Provins. (not to Senlis).


#### Unlikely - Honfleur 

Looks nice but it would be six hours round trip, probably cannot do this.

#### Unlikely - Brussles 

Accessible, but probably too expensive.

"Brussels is no more than 80 minutes from Paris by Thalys, so there is plenty of time for a day trip. There are trains just about every hour. Fares start at 25€ each away if you book on the internet atwww.voyages-sncf.com (no more than 90 days in advance). Walk-up second class fare would be 88€ each way.""
